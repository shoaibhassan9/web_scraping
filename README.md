British Airways Data Scraping & Prediction Model

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Data Scraping & Prediction Model Development project, completed as part of my internship with British Airways. The project focuses on web scraping, data cleaning, exploration, and building a prediction model based on the collected data.

Objectives:
Scrape relevant data from various web sources.
Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights from the data.
Visualize key findings and trends.
Develop a machine learning prediction model to provide actionable insights.

Features:
Web Scraping: Extracts data from targeted websites using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup, etc.
Data Cleaning: Cleans the scraped data to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes and analyzes key patterns using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Prediction Model: Builds a predictive model using Scikit-learn to forecast future trends based on historical data.
